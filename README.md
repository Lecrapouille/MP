**Lecrapouille's Note:**

This current [repository](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MP) is a fork of
Jaroslaw Stanczyk's toolbox that was only accessible from a zip file that is,
now, no more available. I have modified nothing from the original code, except
this current README and some PDF inside the [doc](doc) folder. So consider this
repo as a backup therefore as archive. Once a GitHub repo is archived, you cannot
open issues. If you have questions you asked [here](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MaxPlus.jl).
